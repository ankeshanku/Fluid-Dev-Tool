# FluidDev README

The extension "FluidDev" will ease developers in their workflow while developing Fluid applications.

## Features

This extension contributes the following commands:

* `FluidDev.helloWorld`: Welcome command to confirm that FluidDev is up and running!
* `FluidDev.createComponent`: to create a new component from scratch 
* `FluidDev.runApp`: to run the component's demo app in the browser
* `FluidDev.hotRestart`: to automate rush update and rush rebuild processes

The extension watches the file system for any changes, so that these new changes are reflected in the running demo app.
## Requirements

This extension requires the user to open their local copy of the office-bohemia repository.
